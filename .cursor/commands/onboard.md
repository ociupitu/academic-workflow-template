# Setting Up This Project

## Overview
Comprehensive onboarding process to get a new developer up and running quickly. 

## Onboarding Guidelines
All the verification of the environment setup needs to be done with running prompts in either the terminal or in Cursor. The verification of the cursor setup needs to be done manually.  If failing to confirm that the setup is done correctly, try to install software or package in Cursor or terminal. If manual instructions are needed, provide the user instructions on how to set up the specific requirement. Only provide the user output in the Chatbox and do not provide output into the files of the project. 

If all checklist points are fulfilled, tell the user to continue with running the entire workflow using `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, search for Tasks: Run Task, and run the `full-workflow`. The user can also find this workflow in @.vscode/tasks.json.
